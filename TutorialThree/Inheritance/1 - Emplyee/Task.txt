Many programs written with inheritance could be written with composition instead, and
vice versa. Rewrite class BasePlusCommissionEmployee of the CommissionEmployee–BasePlusCommissionEmployee hierarchy to use composition rather than inheritance. After you do this, assess the relative merits of the two approaches for designing classes CommissionEmployee and BasePlusCommissionEmployee, as well as for object-oriented programs in general. Which approach is more natural? Why?


ANSWER:
For a relatively short program like this one, either approach is acceptable. Inheritance
becomes preferable when it makes the program easier to modify and promotes the
reuse of code. The inheritance approach is more natural because a base-salaried commission
employee is a commission employee. Composition is defined by the “has-a”
relationship, and clearly it would be strange to say that “a base-salaried commission
employee has a commission employee.”
